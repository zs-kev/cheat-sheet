HTML and CSS cheat sheet

This was the first website that I have made using HTML and CSS.

The project is still a work in progress as I would like to implememnt JavaScript in the CSS section as to make it eaiser to navigate.
I would as well like to improve the layout slightly by making it more mobile friendly and adjusting a few elements here and there.
